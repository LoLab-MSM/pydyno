# TroPy

We present TroPy, a novel approach to study cellular signaling networks from a dynamic perspective. This method combines the Quasi-Steady State approach with max-plus algebra to find the driver species and the specific reactions that contribute the most to species concentration changes in time. Hence, it is possible to study how those driver species and reactions change for different parameter sets that fit the data equally well. Finally, it is possible to identify clusters of parameter that generate similar modes of signal execution in signal transduction pathways.
